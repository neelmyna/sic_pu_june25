We are going to link our Git Repo on our system.
We are going to create a copy of the Git Repo in our system which we shall call as local Repo.
Now to work on the local Repo, we have to 1st link our Git Account with our computer (configuration)
Now we can work on the Local Repo. However, if we have to update the Remote Repo (server) w.r.t. the local Repo we have top authenticate everytime.
To avoid authentication for every PUSH, we can use PAT (Personal Access Token).

STEPS TO CREATE PAT:
Right top corner of logged-in page, click the profile icon
Scroll down and click settings
next page, scroll down and click developer settings (left bottyom)
next page, left top, click personal access token (select tokens classic)

Click Expiration, select No Expiry
Now select the top check box named Repo
Now fully scroll down and click generate PAT button
Next page, copy the PAT and Mail it to yourself (mail subject: git pat). So that the PAT is always with you and also safely.
